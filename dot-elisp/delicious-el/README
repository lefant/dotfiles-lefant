You will need a version with a url-version string of either "Emacs" or
"Exp". These are currently the two versions I'm trying to
support. "Emacs" is the one that comes bundled with CVS Emacs. I can
try to support more, but it gets to be a headache real fast.

* Overview

This is a complete set of functions for interacting with <http://del.icio.us>,
a "social bookmarking" project written and maintained by Joshua Shachter.

'delicioapi.el' contains the back-end functions that interact with the API,
behind the scenes. I have kept these in a separate file to make them available
for others to use in writing their own delicious applications, without being
required to load the commands that I have written. 

'delicious.el' contains the front-end interactive functions and commands for
putting the API functions to productive use, via Emacs. 'delicioapi.el' must be
loaded for these functions to work. 

'planner-delicious.el' contains functions to integrate with Planner in
Emacs. It requires Planner, which can be found at
<http://sacha.free.net.ph>. This is included primarily for testing
purposes. For instructions, please see the comments at the top of the file.

The del.icio.us API does go through frequent changes; I've made an effort here
to structure the code so that these changes can be easily accommodated.

The specifications for the API are at <http://del.icio.us/doc/api>.

* Getting started

First, you need to set up an account at del.icio.us, by visiting that site and
following the instructions there.

Second, load the delicious-el files. Either put them in a directory that is
already in your load-path (M-x describe-variable <ret> load-path <ret> to see
what that is) or evaluate:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/delicious-el/files")
  
Then, you need to set a few required options. You can do this either through
Customize, with:

  M-x customize-group <ret> delicious <ret>

or by evaluating something like the following:

  (setq delicious-api-user "myusername"
        delicious-api-password "mypassword")

If you decide you want to have the delicious-el functions available to you
automatically when you start Emacs, add:

  (require 'delicious)
  (setq delicious-api-user "myusername"
        delicious-api-password "mypassword")
  (delicious-api-register-auth)

to your `.emacs' file, making sure that both `delicious.el' and `delicioapi.el'
are somewhere in your load path.

del.icio.us has requested that you limit your hits to the API to a reasonable
amount. In particular, it is requested that you do not do anything that will
trigger one hit to del.icio.us for every hit to your web site. In order to
respect that, this program does a number of things (and will do more in the
future) to cache information locally.

* Interactive commands to use and what to expect

- M-x delicious-post

This is the command to post a URL to your del.icio.us account. The first time
you execute this command in an Emacs session, delicious-el will fetch from the
server the list of tags you've used so far, and a complete list of all your
posts to date. You will then be prompted for information for the new post. The
only required information is the URL itself and a description. Everything else
is optional.

delicious-el will try to guess the URL that you want to enter. If you are in a
w3m-el buffer, it will suggest the URL of the site you are looking at. If not,
if there is a URL under the cursor, it will suggest that.  If neither of these
two things are true, it will scan the current buffer for a URL. It will suggest
the first one that it finds. Next, it will check the clipboard and see if there
is a URL there. If it doesn't find one, it will just put an "http://" in the
input line for you.

URL is a required field. If you try to enter a blank URL, the program will
abort. 

When prompted for tags, enter one at a time, hitting enter after each. You have
tab-completion available in typical Emacs style, based on all of the tags you
have used in the past. When you are done entering tags, just hit enter at the
prompt. delicious-el will suggest possible tags above the prompt. Suggestions
currently are just a list of words that appear both in your current buffer and
in your tags list.

delicious-el will attempt to guess an appropriate description. If you
are in a w3m-el buffer, delicious-el will suggest the title of the page being
viewed as a description. If you are looking at an article in gnus, it will
suggest the title of the article as a description. If you like the suggestion,
hit enter. If you don't, just erase it and type your own.

The server requires some kind of description be entered. If you don't enter
one, the program will abort. 

Extended Description is the next field, and it's all up to you. No guessing
attempts are made here.

Next is the Date/Time prompt. It's not pretty, and will be improved in the
future. If you don't enter anything here, the current date will be used. If you
do want to enter the date, the format is indicated in the prompt.

Once you enter the Date/Time and hit enter, the URL should be posted to the
server!

- M-x delicious-post-offline

This works the same as the normal post command, but instead of sending your
request to the server, it will save it to disk. You can do multiple posts this
way, and they will all be stored. Then when you are online and ready to upload
the posts to the server, call M-x delicious-post-cache to send them all. You'll
be prompted to clear the cache after the posts have been sent.

- M-x delicious-rename-tag

This will prompt you for an old tag and one or more new tags. As usual, you can
use tab completion when entering this information. In fact, the old tag you
enter must match an existing tag. The old tag will be changed to the new tags
for all posts that had the old tag. After the renaming is done, the local tag
list will be refreshed from the server.

- M-x delicious-delete-post

Use this to delete a post by entering its URL. Currently this command is dumb;
there is no completion, and it won't check to see if the post exists before
trying to delete it. But it works to delete things, and there will be time for
improvements later.

- M-x delicious-build-posts-list

This command will refresh the local list of your posts from the server. You
shouldn't use this often. The reason posts are cached locally is to avoid
bothering the server too much. There isn't much reason to use this command,
because any posts made during your current session are recorded locally. But if
you suspect that something has gone wrong, you can use this command to refresh
from the server. Or, if you add posts from an external interface like your
non-emacs web browser, it would be useful to refresh the local list. 

Normally, we use whichever copy of the posts is newer. If your local list has
become corrupt and you need to insist on fetching a new one from the server,
use C-u M-x delicious-build-posts-list to skip the timestamp comparison and go
straight to the server.

* Interactive search commands

Although some filtering can be done via the API, we have some search features
that operate on the local copy of your posts list. This enables us to have much
more powerful searching, means you aren't dependent on your internet connection
to be able to search your posts, and minimizes load on the del.icio.us server.

All of the search commands will display their results in a "*delicious search
results*" buffer, which is displayed in Delicious Search mode. The default is
for this buffer to open in a window other than the active one, or for a second
window to be created if none is available. Delicious Search mode will also add
more useful shortcuts in the future. While in the results, buffer, use C-h m to
see the current bindings.

Results are currently unsorted. At least, no intentional sorting is
applied. That will change in the future. 

Links and tags are clickable, with either the return key or middle click of the
mouse. Clicking on a link will load the link in your default Emacs web
browser. Clicking on a tag will peform a new search displaying all the posts
that have that tag.

The basic search command is:

- M-x delicious-search-posts-regexp

This command will prompt you for a regular expression, search all the fields in
all of your posts for matches, and display the matches.

More targeted searching can be achieved by:

- M-x delicious-search-description-regexp

This command will prompt you for a regular expression, search only the
description field of your posts for matches, and display them.

- M-x delicious-search-href-regexp

This command will prompt you for a regular expression, search only the
href/link field of your posts, and display the matches.

- M-x delicious-search-tags-regexp

This command will prompt you for a regular expression, search only the tag
field of your posts, and display the matches. When searching, it may be useful
to remember that multiple tags are separated by whitespace. 

Since tags are the means for organizing links in del.icio.us, we have a special
search function just for them:

- M-x delicious-search-tags

This command will prompt you for tags, one at a time. You can enter as many as
you like, and you can use <TAB>, <SPC>, or '?' to use Emacs minibuffer
completion based on your previously used tags. Just hit enter at the prompt
when you are done. A search will be done for all of the posts that have all of
those tags. The results will be displayed the same as the other search
commands. The order of the tags is not considered important when determining
matches. You do not need to account for whitespace between tags with this
method.

- M-x delicious-search-hash

You can search for a post by its hash field, if you really want to.

* Delicious Search Mode

There are some additional commands conveniently available to you while in a
Delicious Search mode buffer. 

- M-x delicious-search-add-tags

When you are over the list of tags for a post, this command is bound to
'a'. You will be prompted for successive tags. Enter as many as you want, with
a blank line to end. You will be prompted to see whether the timestamp should
be updated with the current time, or whether the original timestamp for the
post should be preserved. After that, the post will be resubmitted to the
server with the new tags and the search buffer will be updated.

- M-x delicious-search-delete-tags

When you are over the list of tags for a post, this command is bound to
`d'. This works the same as delicious-search-add-tags, except that all the tags
you enter will be deleted from the current post.

- M-x delicious-search-who-else

When you are over any field of a post, this command is bound to `w'. It will
open a page with your default browser showing all of the other del.icio.us
users who have bookmarked this URL.

* Useful noninteractive functions

Noninteractive functions can't be called directly with M-x in Emacs. You can
call them in a variety of ways, including M-: (function-here), or by typing
(function-here) in the *scratch* buffer, moving to after the closing
parenthesis, and typing C-x C-e. Or you can call them from within your own
Emacs Lisp programs.

- (delicious-api-html)

This is a noninteractive function you can use to fetch an HTML feed of posts
from del.icio.us according to a long list of arguments. It's very rough at the
moment, but it seems to work. An interactive frontend is forthcoming. Note that
if you do not give it a user name to fetch posts from, it will default to using
your `delicious-api-user' name.

You can use this function, for example, to track the recent posts from users
whose interests you think overlap with yours, or you can use it to include your
own most recent delicious postings in your blog, especially if you blog using
emacs-wiki.el.

You can read the documentation on the server for the HTML feed parameters at
<http://del.icio.us/doc/html>.

You can set defaults for all of the parameters in the delicious customize
group, or by setting any of the variables in the following list. When you call
(delicious-api-html), you have to have the many arguments in order. If you want
to use your default for one of the arguments, just put `nil' in the function
call in the spot for that argument. That will cause your default to be used. If
you have a value other than nil for an argument in the function call, that
value will be used rather than the default. So, if you want to call
(delicious-api-html) to get the 20 most recent links from johnsu01's
del.icio.us account, but your default is set at 15, you would do this:

(delicious-api-html "johnsu01" nil 20)

If you usually want an RSS button to be included with your list, and you have
your default set accordingly, but want in this case not to have the RSS button,
you would do:

(delicious-api-html "johnsu01" nil 20 nil nil nil nil nil nil nil nil "no")

Note that both of these examples specify `nil' for the TAGNAME argument. This
means that the most recent posts, regardless of tag, will be
returned. Specifying a TAGNAME will return only posts with that tag. 

Here is the list of parameters and a very brief description of each.

+ delicious-api-html-count
  The number of times to show by default when fetching an HTML del.icio.us feed. The server default is 15.

+ delicious-api-html-extended
  Either 'title' or 'body'. The server default is `title'. This means that the
  extended description will just be displayed in the link's title attribute. If
  you want the extended description to be displayed on its own, use `body'.

+ delicious-api-html-divclass
  Class to use for div. The server default is `delPost'.

+ delicious-api-html-aclass
  Class to use for a link. The server default is `delLink'.

+ delicious-api-html-tags 
  Show tags or not. Server default is to show tags. Set this to true if you do NOT want tags.

+ delicious-api-html-tagclass
  Class to use for tags. Server default is `delTag'.

+ delicious-api-html-tagsep
  String to use for separator. Server default is `delTagSep'.

+ delicious-api-html-tagsepclass
  Class to use for separator. Server default is `delTagSep'.

+ delicious-api-html-bullet
  HTML entity to use for bullet. Set it to empty for no bullet. Server default is `raquo'.

+ delicious-api-html-rssbutton
  Add an RSS feed button using CSS. Server default is to show a button with `yes'.

+ delicious-api-html-extendeddiv
  This is whether to put the extended description for the entry in its own
  <div>. The server default is `no'.

+ delicious-api-html-extendedclass
  This the class to use for the extendeddiv. The server default is empty.

* Advanced use

- Binding commands to keys

The author uses this in his `.emacs' to bind `delicious-post' to <C-c p>. 

(global-set-key "\C-cp" 'delicious-post)

* Integration with other Emacs modes

- w3m

Integration with w3m is one of the things that I'm working on right
now. So far, I've implemented these features:

-- URL and description guessing. The program will use the current page in the
   w3m buffer if you are using w3m as a suggestion for the link to post. It
   will use the current page name as a suggestion for the description of the
   link.

-- delicious-w3m-html. This is an interactive command to visit the HTML feed of
   a user's del.icio.us feed. If you call it with a prefix argument (C-u M-x
   delicious-w3m-html), the feed will be displayed in a new session. The
   default parameters are the same as the ones you set to use
   `delicious-api-html'. You can configure them in the `delicious' customize
   group, or individually (they all have the name delicious-api-html-*). After
   issuing the command, you will be prompted for the username, number of posts,
   and tag to filter by. Hitting return at these prompts will cause the
   defaults to be used. The defaults are indicated in the prompts. After
   collecting the information, w3m will then visit a page constructed according
   to your parameters in a w3m buffer.

-- delicious-w3m-bookmark-recent. This is the beginning of a larger effort at
   integrating delicious with w3m bookmarks. It is an interactive command that
   will add your delicious posts to your w3m bookmarks file. It operates based
   on recent posts. You tell it how many posts to scan, what tag (or tag
   intersection like "foo+bar" to filter by, and what w3m bookmark section to
   put the posts in. It will deposit the matching posts in that section,
   without checking for duplicates or making any effort at synching (yet). Note
   that you need to have the `w3m-bookmarks.el' library loaded to use this feature.

-- delicious-w3m-export. This is an interactive command that will export a w3m
   bookmark section to del.icio.us. It's very primitive and not 100% reliable
   at the moment. You can export one section at a time. When prompted for the
   section name, <tab> will complete based on your existing sections. You can
   then enter tags just like you do when you post. These tags will all be
   assigned to each entry in the w3m section. You must enter at least one
   tag. After that, you can enter an optional extended description and time
   parameter, which will be attached to all of the posts from this section. I
   say it's not 100% reliable because a few times I've had some posts not show
   up, and I haven't figured out why yet. Also, this command may not behave if
   your `w3m-bookmark-section-format' is not something close to
   "<h2>%s</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"%s\">%s</a>\n<!--End of section (do not
   delete this comment)-->\n</ul>\n". It _should_ work as long as the section
   titles are enclosed in "<h2></h2>", each bookmark begins with <li>, and each
   bookmark only occupies one line. Future versions may be more flexible in
   this regard and will do verification of your posts. You need to have the
   `w3m-bookmarks.el' library loaded to use this feature.

* Problems

- HTTP errors

Currently, it is not uncommon for the del.icio.us server to be temporarily
unavailable. delicious-el should report any specific errors it receives. If you
want more information, check the contents of the *delicious output*
buffer. Errors with the server are very often temporary. You can resubmit your
post by doing C-x ESC ESC (the default binding for repeat-complex-command) and
using the up arrow to move back to the delicious-post command in your history,
and hitting enter. If you are still getting a server error, then you can use
delicious-post-offline to save the post to your cache. Later on, use
delicious-post-cache to send the post to the server.
